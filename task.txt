"The Global Warming, is it a myth?"
 
The file "meteo_data.json.gzip" contains data from temperature sensors  showing a daily-average temperature in C. The file contains info about date, latitude, longitude and temperature in C.
  
The task: 
    - step 1:  Load the file so it is available for processing (preferably as a big-data Spark RDD, DataFrame or alike). 
               Display short sample of the data.
    - step 2:  Find average temperature by year (you may plot  a chart) and answer if the data shows there is a global 
               warming visible or not;
    - step 3:  inspect the  file gps_country_city.csv file  - it contains the major cities in the world with reference 
               to country and it's coordinates. Find a way to join the data from files to data you get in step 1. 
               Please not the coordinates of temperature sensors not match exactly to city coordinates. 
               You may need to find the city located nearest to sensor coordinates. 
               For simplification of distance calculation we may consider the Earth to be flat. 
               Display a sample of joint data set. Find the average temperature in Germany in year 2011.
